# Who_even_are_you
Hey there!<br>
my name is Sophie Power and I'm a Tech Recruiter (soz) who works predominantly with Start-up/Scale-up businesses hiring in tech.
<br>
<b>What else?</b><br>
Love outdoor swimming, scuba diving, reading, and travelling.  <br>
Used to run a tea drinking society<br>
Currently run DBR - which I've heard described as "the dark web of internal recruitment" (it's not, it's just memes and rants about LinkedIn - we all hate it too)
<br>Tech wise I've worked in hiring Native Mobile devs (iOS and Android) for consumer-facing mobile apps; Full Stack JS devs for a web-based recruitment marketplace. <br>I've even dabbled in hiring PHP Devs (laravel) from time to time. 
<br>I like to think I'm funny (my mum says I am, but only when I don't mean to be).
<br><i>This is a work in progress, I'm hoping to add interesting content etc as I go...</i>
